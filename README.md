# Vegetable Classification Using Deep Learning 

## Overview
This project aims to classify different types of vegetables using deep learning techniques. By automating the classification process, we enhance accuracy and efficiency over traditional manual methods.

## Problem Statement
The objective is to develop a robust system that can accurately identify various vegetables from images, enabling applications in retail and consumer technology.

## Significance
- **Accuracy and Consistency**: Reduces human errors associated with manual classification.
- **Speed and Efficiency**: Automates and accelerates the sorting process.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling large datasets effectively.
- **Applications**: Enhancements in inventory management and consumer assistance.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Vegetable Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/misrakahmed/vegetable-image-dataset), which contains images of various vegetables for classification.

## Models Developed
We trained and evaluated five different models, each with varying architectures and performance metrics:

1. **Model 1: CNN**
   - **Accuracy**: 93.30%
   - **[Colab Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ydRIZm6uVzy30RNAh6ZteAJUKpeADOfj?usp=sharing)**

2. **Model 2: ResNet50**
   - **Accuracy**: 99.50%
   - **[Colab Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J3bK5pongsnAeUYPucydGUHf9kVq0ZDe?usp=sharing)**

3. **Model 3: InceptionV3**
   - **Accuracy**: 77.20%
